SilentDragonLite is a lightwallet for HUSH ($HUSH) which runs on Linux and Windows. This does not require you to download the full blockchain. This is experimental software under active development!

## PRIVACY NOTICE

SilentDragonLite contacts a few different external websites to get various bits of data.

	* coingecko.com for price data API 
	* explorer.hush.is for explorer links 
	* dexstats.info for address utilities 
	* hush-lightwallet.de to get Data

This means your IP address is known to these servers. Enable Tor setting in SilentDragonLite to prevent this, or better yet, use TAILS: https://tails.boum.org/

## Installation

Go to the [releases page](https://git.hush.is/hush/SilentDragonLite/releases) and grab the latest installers or binary. For any Arch Linux users, we also have packages on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) which can be installed with **[yay -S silentdragonlite](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/silentdragonlite/)** or with **[yay -S silentdragonlite-appimage](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/silentdragonlite-appimage/)** for the AppImage package.

## Install Torsocks (or any other Socks service for TOR) on Ubuntu 18.04
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install torsocks
```
## Connection to our TOR onion service Server
```
* Open SDL  Edit->Settings->LightwalletServer->6onaaujm4ozaokzu.onion:80
* Open the folder of SDL in a Terminal -> Enter: TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL=1 torsocks -i ./SilentDragonLite
```
## Note Management
SilentDragonLite does automatic note and utxo management, which means it doesn't allow you to manually select which address to send outgoing transactions from. It follows these principles:
* Defaults to sending shielded transactions, even if you're sending to a transparent address
* Sapling funds need at least 2 confirmations before they can be spent
* Can select funds from multiple shielded addresses in the same transaction
* Will automatically shield your transparent funds at the first opportunity
* When sending an outgoing transaction to a shielded address, SilentDragonLite can decide to use the transaction to additionally shield your transparent funds (i.e., send your transparent funds to your own shielded address in the same transaction)

## Compiling from source
* SilentDragonLite is written in C++ 14, and can be compiled with g++/clang++/visual c++. 
* It also depends on Qt5, which you can get from [here](https://www.qt.io/download). 
* You'll need Rust v1.41 +

### Building on Linux

```
git clone https://git.hush.is/hush/SilentDragonLite
